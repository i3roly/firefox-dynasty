    description: >
      Recorded when a new profile from a profile group becomes the default
      startup profile for the group. This may happen when a profile other
      than the current default is launched from the profile selector window,
      or when the user has multiple profiles running at the same time and
      switches app focus to a profile other than the current default. An
      event is not recorded if the current default profile is launched or
      gains app focus.
