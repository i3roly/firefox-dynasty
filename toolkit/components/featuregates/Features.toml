# is-public-jexl and default-value-jexl are both JEXL expressions.
# They are evaluated using the Experimenter environment, plus some
# additional variables defined by ASRouter and FeatureGate.
# The result of evaluating is-public-jexl is exposed as `isPublic`
# and controls whether the feature is shown to the user in e.g.
# the relevant pane in Firefox's settings.
# The result of evaluating default-value-jexl is exposed as
# `defaultValue` and should match the default value of the pref
# as set in the relevant .js prefs file or StaticPrefList.yaml.
#
# NOTE ON ORDERING
# The ordering of the groups and controls in about:preferences is
# determined by the ordering in this file. Groups will be ordered
# based on the order of appearance in this file. Settings within
# a group will also be determined by their order in this file.
